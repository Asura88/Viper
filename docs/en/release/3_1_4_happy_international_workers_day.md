## Penetration Testing Agent

- The agent now supports MSF-related functionality
- The agent can currently perform automated penetration testing by calling multiple built-in tools

> The current automation capabilities of the agent are in the proof-of-concept stage

## AI Agent

- Added interrupt function, users can manually interrupt the agent's operation from the interface

> The new agent performs multiple rounds of automated tool calls during penetration testing, so the interrupt function is essential

- Optimized UI interaction and performance
