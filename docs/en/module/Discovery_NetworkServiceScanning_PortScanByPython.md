# Internal Network Port Scan

Port scanning of the target internal network.

The scanning script executes on the target host, and all scanning network traffic remains within the target internal network.

If other modules need to connect to discovered services, please add corresponding routes or use Socks proxy with this Session.

## Operation Method

- Fill in the scanning parameters and run
- Scanned IP addresses will be added to the host list
- View scanned port information through the `Open Ports` option
- View network discovery status through IP address connections in `Network Topology`
