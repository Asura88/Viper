# Windows WDigest Switch

# Main Function
This is used to turn on the WDigest credential storage switch. The WDigest switch is turned off by default in Windows 8/2012 and above versions.

The switch can be turned on by modifying the `UseLogonCredential` value in the registry.

After the user logs off and logs back in, mimikatz can be used to capture passwords. <font style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);">.</font>
