# Memory execution C# executable file

# Main functions

The module loads the exe file written in C# into memory and executes it using CLR.

The controlled host needs to be installed .net2.0 (win2008 default installation) or .net4.0 (win2012 default installation).

The executable file needs to be the same as the controlled host.net version.

The function is similar to the execute-assembly of CS. When C# needs to enter parameters, you need to make sure to fill in the parameters.
