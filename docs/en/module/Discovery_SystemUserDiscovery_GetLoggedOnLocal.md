# Get Currently Logged-on Users

The module retrieves information about currently logged-on users on remote hosts within the domain.

The module requires normal domain user permissions, and remote hosts need to have the Remote Registry feature enabled.

The hostnames can be obtained using the `Get Information of All Domain Hosts` module.
