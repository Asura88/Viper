# Internal Network Port Scanning and Service Identification

Scan for open TCP ports in the internal network and identify the services, software, versions, etc. of the discovered ports.

All the scanning network traffic is within the target internal network. If other modules need to connect to the discovered services, please add the corresponding routes and Socks proxies.
