# Ladon7.0 C# Plugin

The module executes the C# version of Ladon's exe in memory. The exe required by the module can be downloaded from the following link:
(Unzip password: k8gege.org) https://github.com/k8gege/Ladon/releases/download/v7.0/Ladon7.0.rar

Since Ladon is not fully open-source, Viper does not guarantee the security of the built-in Ladon-N20.exe and Ladon-N40.exe. It is recommended to upload the corresponding exe to
the `File Explorer` yourself.
