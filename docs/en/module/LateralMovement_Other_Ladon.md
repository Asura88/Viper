# Ladon7.0 C# Plugin


Execute the C# version of Ladon's exe in module memory. The exe required by the module can be downloaded from the following link: (Unzip password: k8gege.org) https://github.com/k8gege/Ladon/releases/download/v7.0/Ladon7.0.rar. Since Ladon is not fully open - sourced, Viper does not guarantee the security of the built - in Ladon - N20.exe and Ladon - N40.exe. It is recommended to upload the corresponding exe to `File List` by yourself.
