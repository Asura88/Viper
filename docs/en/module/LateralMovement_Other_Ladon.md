# Ladon7.0 C# plugin

# Main functions

The module memory executes the C# version of Ladon exe. The exe required for the module is downloaded from the following link: (decompression password
k8gege.org) https://github.com/k8gege/Ladon/releases/download/v7.0/Ladon7.0.rar Because Ladon is not completely open source, Viper does not guarantee the security of built-in
Ladon-N20.exe and Ladon-N40.exe. It is recommended to upload the corresponding exe to `file list` by yourself.
