# MS17-010 Exploitation (CSharp)

The module executes a customized Eternalblue.exe in memory.

The module supports two modes: Detect and Exploit, and supports MS17-010 exploitation on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.

Compared with the official MSF MS17010 exploit, when this module performs vulnerability exploitation, all network traffic is sent within the internal network without needing to be routed and forwarded from the server to the internal network through Session, resulting in a higher success rate.
