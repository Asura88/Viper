# MS17-010 Exploitation (CSharp)


The module executes a customized Eternalblue.exe in memory.

The module supports two modes: Detect and Exploit, and can exploit MS17-010 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.

Compared with the official MSF MS17010 exploit, when this module exploits the vulnerability, all network traffic is sent within the intranet, without the need to route and forward from the server to the intranet through a session, resulting in a higher success rate.
