# Memory execution Shellcode file

# Main functions

Inject shellcode into host memory and execute, the file suffix must be bin.

Shellcode execution is strongly related to the CPU architecture, and the arch options must be filled in accurately.

If you do not need shellcode output (such as payload is online), you do not need to check to get the output.

If you need to get the output after shellcode execution (mimikatz), please check the Get output option and fill in the waiting time
