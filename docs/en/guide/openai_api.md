# OPENAI API

The intelligent assistant relies on OpenAI's API. Please configure the `api_key` before use.

### easy/reasoning/function_calling

You can add multiple configurations, each meeting different functional requirements. For example, for models like o3-mini and deepseek-r1, select the `reasoning` tag. For models like gpt-4o-mini and qwen-turbo, select the `easy` and `function_calling` tags. This way, you can achieve a balance among cost, effectiveness, and speed.
