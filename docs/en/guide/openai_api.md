### easy/reasoning/function_calling

Multiple configurations can be added, each configuration meets different functional requirements, such as o3-mini, deepseek-r1, etc., select the reasoning tag. gpt-4o-mini, qwen-turbo, etc., select the easy, function_calling tag.
This will achieve a balance of cost/effect/speed.
