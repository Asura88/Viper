# License

## Basic vs Professional

After installation, Viper defaults to the Basic version. It can be upgraded to the Pro version after purchasing a subscription. 

For a comparison of version features or purchase a subscription, please refer to the [Pricing](../pricing.md) page.

## Activating Devices
After purchasing a subscription, the system will send a License code to your email. 

Log in to Viper and enter the License code under `Platform Settings` `License` to activate the Pro version subscription.

Each License can activate up to 10 devices simultaneously. Devices that are deactivated will not count towards the 10-device limit.

## Deactivating Devices
To deactivate a device, click the `Deactivate` button under `Platform Settings` `License`.

## Subscription Expiration
After a subscription expires, the system will automatically disable Pro version features, but you can still use the Basic version features. 

If you wish to continue using Pro version features, please purchase a subscription.
